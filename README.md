# Bike_Sales_Report_System_Using_Java

This Java program manages a bike sales report by utilizing a Bike class to store attributes like name, model, year, and price. In the main method, it leverages the Scanner class to collect user-defined bike counts and comma-separated details, which are processed using string splitting and stored in an array of objects. By combining loops, method calls, and automated customer ID generation, the system demonstrates core object-oriented programming concepts such as encapsulation, data handling, and basic input/output operations.
